DATA WAREHOUSE & ANALYSIS As a fresh college graduate, I started my IT career as IS Analyst with SQL. We used Oracle version 9i to manage large amounts of data. This data was later integrated and checked to work with a third party tool that create report and automate them in a proprietary language native to the tool itself. These reports were later spot checked for accuracy against sql queries. VBA was also used to create specialized macros that format these reports. https://github.com/clayman33/VBA

DATA FORMS DEVELOPMENT My contributions developing with third party tools to create an automated data flow from SAP to a XML forms that create an output to industrial label printer networked overseas. Application support is one of specialties. Network troubleshooting is also one of my passions.

FRONT END DEVELOPMENT As Software Engineer, I’m trying to specialize on Front End development. I have several projects and snippets that can looked at.

MOBILE FORMS DEVELOPMENT I also created a mobile HTML forms that would be created with VBA code and then uploaded to AWS application that would be integrated with Maximo to retrieve that data. These forms could be used from any device or workstation.
